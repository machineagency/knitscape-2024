KnitScape is a design and simulation tool for designing pattern repeats for knit
slip/tuck colorwork patterns. This is an archival version of the KnitScape
editor which accompanies the CHI 2024 paper
[KnitScape: Computational Design and Yarn-Level Simulation of Slip and Tuck Colorwork Knitting Patterns](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642799).
