# KnitScape-2024

KnitScape is a design and simulation tool for machine knitting built by Hannah
Twigg-Smith. 

# [You can use KnitScape-2024 here!](https://machineagency.github.io/knitscape-2024)

This is an archival version of the KnitScape editor specifically
for designing slip and tuck colorwork patterns which accompanies the CHI 2024
paper
[KnitScape: Computational Design and Yarn-Level Simulation of Slip and Tuck Colorwork Knitting Patterns](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642799).
This version will no longer be actively developed; future development will
continue in [the dedicated KnitScape org](https://github.com/knitscape/). For

[here](https://github.com/machineagency/knitscape-2024/wiki).
