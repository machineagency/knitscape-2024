# KnitScape-2024

KnitScape is a design and simulation tool for machine knitting made by Hannah
Twigg-Smith. This is an archival version of the KnitScape editor specifically
for designing slip and tuck colorwork patterns which accompanies the CHI 2024
paper
[KnitScape: Computational Design and Yarn-Level Simulation of Slip and Tuck Colorwork Knitting Patterns](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642799).
